_"Okay, what's your plan? How are we getting out of here?"_

_"Fatty"_

While she was clearly referring to the guard, Santo was getting tired of how short her answers always were. It would have been a lot easier to plan and facilitate a break-out if she was more straightforward and communicative.

_"Look, for the love of god, start telling me more clearly what your plan is, or else we'll never finish this so-called **escape**"_

_"I don't need you for the escape, I need you for the leaving."_

Even though getting out of the holding cell was a kind of "leaving", he had a strong feeling that she had some plan to steal, or otherwise acquire a VV, and that plan needed a second person.

_"Just wait, and watch."_

She then fiddled with something in her right hand, he couldn't see it though. She didn't fiddle for long though, because she then got up and walked up to the bars and called the man over.

_"Oh Hank-y, I need to pee, and I'm uncomfortable going with this weirdo in the cell with me."_

That was possibly the most he'd ever heard her say, and this time she said it with a somewhat jovial tone, instead of her normal deadpan, flat delivery. It was like she'd transformed into a completely different person.

_"Look, I's not supposed to let you out, ya remember that other time you got out before I was supposed to let you go? I got a serious talkin to."_

She did the signature "I need to pee" wiggle, and whimpered quietly.

_"Fine fine, just make it quick, and don't fuck me over this time."_

_"You got it"_

He approached the door to unlock it. As he fumbled with his keys Santo could see her squirming stop, and she seemed to get into a ready position, he wasn't sure what for yet. Once Hank had unlocked the door, she walked through it, and gracefully got behind him. She then slapped him in the neck, and he froze for a moment, and then fell over.

_"WHOA What'd you do? Is he okay? I don't want to get charged with... Whatever that was."_

_"He's fine. Gotta go."_

She was right back to her old tone and posture. It seems that she was actually just a good actress. Santo scuffled out of the cell, somewhat uncomfortable with the situation, but also happy he didn't have to do anything to escape. Clearly she really did have a plan.

_"Oh, hey, where's my stuff? I'd like to leave with my things."_

_"Closet."_

She pointed to an upright locker on the wall next to Hank's desk. It was already ajar, clearly this station wasn't the pinnacle of security, but this town in general wasn't especially known for its vigilance. Santo walked over to the locker, and looked in. There was his bag, his SHADE, his pistol, all together. There was also a box of ammunition, they were smalls, so he took them.

Having his bag made him significantly more comfortable, it was like family at this point, and it was his lifeline of sorts. There were several circumstances where he would have died if it wasn't for something in his bag. He had all sorts of small tools like a wrench, and small hammer, 2 knives, and a chisel, which is surprisingly useful. On top of that he always kept some rations in his bag which he swore to never touch unless he was actually **starving**.

_"Hurry up"_

Santo had been standing at the locker long enough that she was getting tired of waiting for him to finish up.

_"Coming coming... What's your name anyways? I never got that from you."_
