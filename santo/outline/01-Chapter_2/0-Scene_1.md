Santo woke up to a woman's face looking down at him. She looked young, probably in her mid-20s, and definitely younger than 40. Tanned complexion, tired eyes,  teeth, dirty skin, greasy, messy hair, and the smell of body odour. She looked like she was thinking hard, almost confused, but it was hard to determine what she might have been thinking. It took some time, but eventually he cleared his throat and just let a single _"Hi?"_ Slip out of his mouth.

Santo wasn't generally one to measure his words carefully, sometimes he tried, but it rarely really worked. For the most part, he either stayed pretty much silent, or would go on long tirades and rants. Neither one served him very well, but overall the silence was less detrimental to his life and relationships.

_"Why are you here?"_

Her response was candid, which was refreshing, but also a little surprising. She spoke with a very dead cadence and tone, as if she didn't really care to speak at all. Left with a moment to think about his situation, he finally sat up, which forced her to stop looking down on him, or else she'd get her nose **bonk**ed by his forehead.

He rubbed his eyes and breathed out slowly. 

_"Honestly, I don't remember... I was..."_

At that sentence fragment he looked down at his leg, which was bandaged cleanly, and didn't hurt much anymore. Clearly someone other than him thought he shouldn't just bleed out and die, at least not yet. Of course, he was happy to still be alive, but it just raised more questions. 

The cops on Icroria weren't evil, but in general, they wouldn't go out of their way to help someone who was bleeding out in front of a shut-down second-rate clinic. Then, remembering that he had just stopped talking mid-sentence, Santo continued, saying 

_"I got into a bit of an... Engagement, and then I was injured, and headed for that clinic nearby, and I woke up here. Not sure what happened in between those two steps, but I'm just glad I didn't die out front of that shitty place."_

_"Budget body fix? Yeah, shut down."_

_"I know that, I just said that I was outside it, and I... Why would you even- Whatever... Why are you here?"_

_"Live here."_

_"What? What do you mean you live here? You just **live** with the cops?"_

_"Eh"_

At that, Santo was pretty much lost. Her answers were confusing, cryptic, and unhelpful. On top of his difficulty getting useful information out of her, he realized that he didn't really need to know anything about her. He'd probably never see her again. 

Santo stood up from the floor and walked up to the holding cell door. It was solid, so he wouldn't be able to easily break out; especially without any of his stuff. He was hoping that he'd be able to explain his way out of the holding cell. As long as they didn't do a wide query for his identity he'd be fine. In the past he learned that there were some flags attached to his name that alerted some galactic authorities that weren't planning on being kind to him if they ever found him. Fortunately he wasn't high on their list, as far as he knew; they weren't actively looking for him. 

_"Hey! Can I talk to someone? Is there sheriff here?"_
