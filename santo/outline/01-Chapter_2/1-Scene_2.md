A large, slovenly, uniformed man stood up from his chair, he grabbed his coffee cup on the way over to the holding cell. His gait was made up of short slow steps, he clearly wasn't in a hurry. Santo was in a bit of a hurry though, he hated being locked up. Of course, just about anyone hates being locked up, but he also had enough experience with to to know for certain that he'd rather be _almost_ anywhere else.

Once at the cell door, the man looked up at the two people in the cell. She was just sitting there, on the bench, and he was standing at the cell door, looking the man dead in the eyes, somewhat expectantly. Eventually he chimed in

_"Hey, you know, I really really appreciate how you guys patched me up, my leg and all that, it's really awesome. I love that there are still good people out there in the world! Since I'm up now, and honestly, my leg feels fine, I was wondering if I could collect my things and be on my way! You know, I've got some stuff to do, and I don't want to be late..."_

The man in uniform let out a very small sigh before waving a hand at him dismissively.

_"We're still investigating your connection to the three dead men in an alley."_

That was the last thing he wanted to hear, but it was also completely unsurprising. Considering there was probably a blood trail from the scene of the ambush, all the way to where he was found. On top of that, he had a gun on him that had recently been fired, as well as a SHADE that was partly depleted. Which they could almost definitely link to the dead men. Of course, now Santo had to come up with some kind of response that made sense in context, one that wouldn't make the authorities even more suspicious.
