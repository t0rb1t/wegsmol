Proxwake: Designed to wake up the user whenever something is approaching in proximity. Sometimes will register non-dangerous targets like rats and other stuff. \
If you have it hooked into your mods, it has to send a shock that's powerful enough to wake you. If you don't have it hooked into that, or if you don't have any mods to use it with, then you're stuck with one of three options. You have to either opt for smell, sound, or light. \
The smell option is probably the most odd one to choose, because up until the invention of the proxwake, nobody in the history of humanity had really thought of waking yourself up with methyl Mercaptan, let alone invent a way to do that. The sound and light options are problematic because if you have the proxwake set up for the sake of alerting you to nearby approaching dangers, namely humans, then sound and light will make it exceptionally easy to find you. \
