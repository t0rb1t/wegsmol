Waking up to a proxwake is incredibly unpleasant no matter how you spin it. That's how Santo woke up, to the unpleasant sensation of his proxwake. On top of the unpleasant sensation of a proxwake, it's really unpleasant because you're waking up, likely, in the middle of your sleep cycle, **and** you're being woken up to the notion that someone who may or may not be seriously dangerous is probably nearby.

After twisting the two halves of the proxwake cylinder to deactivate it, he rubbed his eyes and looked around. He knew that he should be more awake because of the possible danger, but there had been so many times where his proxwake had gone off when it was nothing more than a rodent, or some small malfunction. Much to his dismay, his tech was not very nice, and he hadn't the means or the know-how to fix it. After a few moments of looking around, and listening for movement he confidently concluded that it was just a glitch, the second glitch this week, but a glitch nonetheless.

He laid his head back down on his makeshift pillow and breathed slowly so as to calm his heart-rate which, while not racing, had sped up a fair bit from the rude awakening. He'd been through this same dance dozens if not hundreds of times, so he was quick to calm down, really, he was quick to change his mood in just about any way. 

Unfortunately for Santo this was not one of those times where calming down is the best thing to do, in fact, unbeknownst to him he should have been getting ready for something much much more interesting. Icroria, the planet that he was currently on, has a strong criminal element, and in his defence, Santo spent most of his time on alert, just waiting for something bad to happen, but sometimes even the most careful person needs a moment to just relax and take a moment.

The proxwake is designed to be unpleasant, and it does a very good job at doing that, but there's little in life that's worse than being attacked while lying down, trying to get back to sleep. Being shot at is pretty bad, but it's worse when you're lying down, trying to sleep. Being attacked is just about one of the most unpleasant things that can happen, and it's even worse when you're in such a helpless state. Either way though, it sucks, and being caught off guard is horrible.

Something about bullets is that most of them actually move faster than sound, meaning that if anything, when you're on the receiving end, you'll actually notice the round hitting its target before you hear the gunshot. Santo hated that.
