All three men were incapacitated or dead, and santo finally had a moment to catch his breath. The first thought that came to him was 
"why the hell didn't they have SHADEs?"
It's simple, if you're going to be in a situation where you might be attacked, you use a SHADE, even if you don't expect to be in a fight it's a smart thing to have, if you can afford it.
Then again, the sound of a SHADE can give away your position, and if these bandits exclusively got people in their sleep then that would actually explain it pretty well.
The specific type of analgesic that he used doesn't last long, so he'll have to find someone to patch him up soon, or else there will be some serious pain problems, and taking another dose so quickly afterwards can be dangerous.
Fortunately for him he still had a working DSCNT. It only took a moment to look up the closest medical area, he didn't really care how good they were, in fact, the cheaper, the better there wasn't a whole lot of disposable income at his disposal. 
The medical clinic he found was called "Budget Body Fix" Which in his opinion was a little on the nose, but to be honest, he actually liked that. It was somewhat refreshing, especially when taking into account the endless marketing of the galactic corporations. At times he dreamed of a galaxy with more independence, and less intervention from the corporations. The worst places were the incorporated planets; the planets that where literally owned by corporations.
