_"You never explained to me how you just slapped him and then he fell over."_

Grim looked back at Santo, she didn't like revealing details about how she operated, but it clearly was going to be something that he wasn't going to let go of.

_"See this?"_

Grim held up a small, flat, round, black object.

_"Uhh-huh what's that?"_

There was a loop attached to it, she slipped the loop over her middle finger, the object was affixed to her finger, on the inner side of her hand.

_"It's a taser. Just one use."_

She then demonstrated by touching it to her other hand several times.

_"I hit him where he nerves are. Knocked him out with the shock."_

_"Oh, neat."_

Santo was impressed, and a little intimidated by how casually she just attacked a law-person, but on the other hand, less than 24 hours ago he had just gotten into a shootout, and killed three people.
