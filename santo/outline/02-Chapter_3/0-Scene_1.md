_"My name? It's... Grim"_

**"I'm tired of people asking me what my name is. Honestly, why can't they be happy just yelling 'hey you' at me? that would be so much more convenient."**

Her name wasn't actually Grim. As far as she knew, she didn't actually have a name. She was sold or abandoned as an infant. Her name was given to her when she was just old enough to have a real personality. Grim was always... Grim, and that's where her name came from.

_"Grim? Like... Darkly serious, depressing?"_

_"Yes"_

She knew that at some point she'd have to have a real conversation with him, but she wanted to put it off as long as possible.

_"I don't want to talk about this anymore"_

_"Oooookay... If you say so."_

She then looked down at her feet, she felt oddly guilty about just brushing him off, but it wasn't that big of a deal. As long as she could trust him in return, things would be fine, and as far as she could think there wasn't anything that she'd done that would give him a reason not to trust her.

_"Look, Santo, I know you want to-"_

_"Hey, how do you know my name?"_

_"Oh, right."_

_"What do you mean 'Oh right'?"_

_"I... Uhm, Hank knew your name, and he said it out loud."_

_"Oh, well why didn't you just say so?"_

**"Because it was a lie"** \
_"Because I was worried you'd think it was weird that I knew your name this whole time."_

_"Okay, okay okay. Two things. You're talking more! That's awesome, I'm glad to hear all of these new and exciting things from you! Doesn't it feel good?"_

_"No."_

_"Okay, we'll work on that. Anyways, thing two... Why would that be weird? It's been like... An hour since I woke up, and now I know your name. That's not that weird."_

She knew that she was uncomfortable talking, the reason was somewhat unclear. There's a chance it was because of the "discipline" she'd experience if she was "chit-chat-chat-chattering" when she was back where she grew up.

_"Can we just move on?"_

_"Hell yeah! Let's do it! I want... I want to help you, help me!"_

_"Stop it with the platitudes."_

_"It's not a platitude, it's just a saying, if you get helped, you can help me. We can benefit each other, and I like that. Besides, I know it's been pretty short, but I already like you."_

At that, Grim froze, there was something about his words that shot her in an emotional place she didn't like. Granted, she didn't like any emotional places, but this one was upsetting her a lot. It didn't occur to her exactly why it was bothering her, but it did. A part of her was brought up from the dirt she buried it under, and that part of her had just bitch-slapped her. It was something that she hadn't dealt with properly, and also didn't bury it deep enough. 

_"Shut up and follow me."_

Avoidance, not healthy, not that effective, but a favorite coping mechanism of many people. Avoidance allows you to not face your problems, even if it means that they continue to fester in your subconscious.

_"Okay, no need to be snippy mate."_

_"What did you just call me?"_

_"Mate! Like cellmate! You were my cellmate!"_

_"Whatever, just... We're going to the shipyard."_

_"Sounds good cap!"_

**"Cap isn't any better. I don't know why he thinks that we have to be friends through this whole thing. Just let it go."**

Grim groaned, paused for a moment, and then just continued walking towards the shipyard.
