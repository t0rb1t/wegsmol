# WEGSMOL
This is a simple set of scripts to create and manage/interact with enemies in my **AWARD WINNING** new games titled *WEGSMOL*

There are 2 modules I "stole", the one in the directory "names" is from Trey Hunter here: https://github.com/treyhunner/names
The file "namegenerator.py" is by "noxan" and can be found here: https://gist.github.com/noxan/5845351#file-namegenerator-py

I don't really know how to properly do submodules, so I just did this. I'm sorry Trey and noxan.
